# 👋 Hello there, I'm Stefano Bargione

## Educational Scientific History

- 🎓 B.Sc. in Sciences and Psychological Techniques ([Lumsa University][https://lumsa.it/en/corsi/science-and-techniques-of-psychology])
- 🎓 M.Sc. in Applied Experimental Psychological Sciences ([Bicocca University][https://www.unimib.it/graduate/applied-experimental-psychological-sciences])

## Current Position
I’m a Ph.D candidate in AI for Health & Life Sciences applications 🤖 🦾🦿🧠

Educated in Experimental Research Design in Psychological Sciences. 
I got acquainted with cross-disciplinary methodological approaches to design test and validate human-like intelligence in smart machines & advanced technologies to support, sustain and monitor psychophysical wellbeing in daily life activities, such as          

- Cognitive & Behavioral Sciences
- UX, Cognitive Ergonomics & Human-Technology Interaction Design
- Data Science 
- Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning, Generative AI) 


## Future Job Aspirations   
To become a Computational (Embodied) Neuroscientist willing to collaboratively contribute to the future generation of human-centered AI technologies in multiple sectors such as **Industrial**, **Corporate Affairs** with a focus on **Healthcare** applications such as:
    
    1) brain-machine interfacing systems (Non-Invasive BCIs -i.e., EEG, fNIRS, MEG, fMRI- & Invasive -ECoG, Neural Implants) 
    2) behavioral-biosensing interfaces (Keystroke/Mouse/Signature dynamics, Gait analysis, Voice biometrics)
    
### Future Job Goals

I would like to 

- Upskill my competences in different sets of healthcare data 🧬 such as Biometrics, Behavioral Informatics & Multi-Omics to contribute to the validation of novel Multi-Scale System-Level Neuroscience Computational Models of Brain & Behavior.
- Contribute to the future generation of human-centered healthcare techs, such as brain-machine interfacing systems & behavioral-biosensing interfaces 🤖 🦾🦿🧠

## ⚙️ Tools I use

- **Experimental Research Softwares**: GPower, Jamovi, Inquisit, E-prime, Qualtrics
- **Neuroscientific Recording Equipments** (TMS, EEG - Brain Vision Recorder & Analyzer Software toolkits - but want to learn more on MEG, fMRI)
- **Programming Languages and Scientific Computing Environments**: Python & R/MATLAB (interoperability with Python frameworks)  
- **Generative AI**: ChatGPT, Claude, V0.dev, Windsurf  
- **Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux, Windows (terminal/SSH usage)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub (still learning along the way 👨🏼‍💻)

## 👨🏼‍💻 Vibe Coding Colloborative Projects  (in the mean time)

- 🧪 [avatar-rome](https://github.com/ku894/avatar-rome) — Builder & Contributor (via [Sundai Club]([https://www.sundai.club/projects]) of rapid prototyping of user-driven AI apps & interfaces
 Generative AI avatar project name: HabitPals (https://www.sundai.club/projects/36cabf61-7da2-4e3a-be16-c0a3fc62aac7)).
